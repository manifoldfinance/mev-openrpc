  "description": "Registers the requesting site with MevRpc as the initiator of onboarding. Returns a Promise that resolves to `true`, or rejects if there's an error. This method is intended to be called after MevRpc has been installed, but before the MevRpc onboarding has completed. You can use this method to inform MevRpc that you were the one that suggested installing MevRpc. This lets MevRpc redirect the user back to your site after onboarding as completed. Instead of calling this method directly, you should use the `@mevrpc/onboarding` library",
